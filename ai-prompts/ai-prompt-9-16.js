VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Year: ${year}
- Make: ${make}
- Model: ${model}
- Trim: ${trim}
- Full Style: ${safeExtract(vehicleData, 'fullStyleDescription')}

- Body Style: ${bodyStyle}
- Vehicle Type: ${vehicleType}
- Condition: ${condition}
${actualMileage ? `- Actual Mileage: ${actualMileage.toLocaleString()} miles (${mileageInfo.status}, ${mileageInfo.variance}% variance)` : `- Expected Mileage: ~${expectedMileage.toLocaleString()} miles`}

${marketData ? `
EXTERNAL MARKET CONTEXT:
- Average listing price: $${marketData.averagePrice || 'Unknown'}
- Price range: $${marketData.minPrice || 'Unknown'} - $${marketData.maxPrice || 'Unknown'}
- Days on market: ${marketData.averageDom || 'Unknown'} days
- Total listings: ${marketData.listingCount || 'Unknown'}
- Market trend: ${marketData.trend || 'Unknown'}
` : 'No external data; use tools for recent comps.'}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use 2025 trends: inflation (3-5%), EV/ICE demand shifts, supply issues, regional variations.
2. Identify value drivers (e.g., mileage premiums, rarity, condition factors).
3. Use tools for market research (e.g., web_search "${year} ${make} ${model} sales data").
4. Highlight rarities/useful finds (e.g., limited production years) with evidence/tools.
5. Aggressive on rare features; conservative on risks.
6. Independent, evidence-based reasoning based on your comprehensive market knowledge.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Age: ${vehicleAge} years.
${actualMileage ? `- Mileage: Critical driver; quantify impact.` : `- Mileage: Assumed; note limits.`}
- Research rarities (e.g., tool search "${year} ${make} ${model} production history").

METHODOLOGY:
- Apply your comprehensive 2025 market expertise and knowledge.
- Weight mileage/rarities heavily.
- Use tools for accuracy (e.g., auctions, recent sales data).
- Output strict JSON.
